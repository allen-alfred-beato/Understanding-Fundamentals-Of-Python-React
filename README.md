# Understanding-Fundamentals-Of-Python-React

# ðŸ§  Python + React Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my journey in learning the fundamentals of **Python** and **React**. This repo serves as a learning log, practice space, and project archive as I work through concepts, mini-projects, and challenges.

## ðŸš€ Why Python and React?

- **Python**: A versatile, beginner-friendly language widely used for web development, data science, automation, and more.
- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building modern, responsive web UIs, and essential for full-stack development.

Combining both opens the door to building full-stack applications â€” from APIs with Python (e.g., Flask or Django) to beautiful frontends with React.
